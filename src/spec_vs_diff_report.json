  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all five requirements (REQ-16 through REQ-20). The main page hero section has been redesigned with the 'Where can we take you?' headline centered over a background image. A flight status indicator has been added to the header navigation that displays operational status with color-coded icons. The backend now includes FlightStatus type definition with setFlightStatus and getFlightStatus functions. The admin dashboard includes a FlightStatusEditor component with dropdown selection and save functionality. The status indicator is connected to the backend via React Query with automatic 30-second refresh intervals.",
